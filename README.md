# Webhookr::Prontoforms
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/zoocasa/webhookr-prontoforms.png)](https://gemnasium.com/zoocasa/webhookr-prontoforms)

This gem is a plugin for [Webhookr](https://github.com/zoocasa/webhookr) that enables
your application to accept [webhooks from Prontoforms](https://support.prontoforms.com/entries/20743117-HTTP-POST-Data-Destination).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'webhookr-prontoforms'

Or install it yourself:

    $ gem install webhookr-prontoforms

## Usage

Once you have the gem installed run the generator to add the code to your initializer.
An initializer will be created if you do not have one.

```console
rails g webhookr:prontoforms:init *initializer_name* -s
```

Run the generator to create an example file to handle ProntoForms webhooks.

```console
rails g webhookr:prontoforms:example_hooks
```

Or create a ProntoForms handler class for any event that you want to handle. For example
to handle unsubscribes you would create a class as follows:

```ruby
class ProntoFormsHooks
  def on_event(incoming)
    # Your custom logic goes here.

  end
end
```

For a complete list of events, and the payload format, see below.

Edit config/initializers/*initializer_name* and change the commented line to point to
your custom Prontoforms event handling class. If your class was called *ProntoFormsHooks*
the configuration line would look like this:

```ruby
  Webhookr::Prontoforms::Adapter.config.callback = ProntoFormsHooks
```

To see the list of ProntoForms URLs for your application can use run the provided webhookr rake task:

```console
rake webhookr:services
```

Example output:

```console
prontoforms:
  GET	/webhookr/events/prontoforms/19xl64emxvn
  POST	/webhookr/events/prontoforms/19xl64emxvn
```

### Versioning
This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Violations of this scheme should be reported as
bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility, that
version should be immediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that restores
compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions. As a
result of this policy, once this gem reaches a 1.0 release, you can (and should) specify a dependency on
this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16#page74) with
two digits of precision. For example:

    spec.add_dependency 'webhookr-prontoforms', '~> 1.0'

While this gem is currently a 0.x release, suggestion is to require the exact version that works for your code:

    spec.add_dependency 'webhookr-prontoforms', '0.0.1'
